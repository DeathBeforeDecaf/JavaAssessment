# Tier01 User Acceptance Tests

Collection of test cases to verify functionality outlined by user requirements, typically defined to guide development
at the beginning of a project and refined throughout product development.  These tests focus on required behaviors
specified by the user when they interact with an operating system/service.


## User Requirements

> **Note:** The user requirements for this system have a much larger scope than what is listed below, typically a test
engineer wants to cover the basic positive test cases outlined by the user requirements here (this is merely sample data
based on complete speculation).
