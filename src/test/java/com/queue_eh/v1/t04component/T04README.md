# Tier04 Component Test Cases

These test cases test each component in functional isolation from the system using mock objects or service stubs to
simulate any dependencies required for the system under test.  These tests typically exist directly within the source
project itself and are directly maintained by the developers, but this varies largely on the how the organization approaches
testing.
